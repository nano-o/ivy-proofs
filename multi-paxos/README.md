The file `multi_paxos_chand.ivy` has been successfully checked with Ivy 1.7,
installed from `https://github.com/Microsoft/ivy`, commit `108385d`, with the
command `ivy_check complete=fo seed=$RANDOM multi_paxos_chand.ivy`. As far as
I know, `complete=fo` disables the fragment checker (indeed, not all the VCs
are in EPR).
